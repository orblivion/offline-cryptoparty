## Why?

In order to allow for a crypto party with a bad or nonexistent Internet connection, it would help to have all of the installers on hand. However, this poses a threat: Like your mom always told you, don't take crypto software from strangers! The instructions here will give you information that will allow you to verify the software that this person gives you. It is likely that not everybody will have time to follow these instructions, but putting this out there means that you're trusting not one person, but the most trustworthy of an *open* pool of people (a closed group could be in cahoots). So it would be appreciated if you help us by being an additional sentry. Doing it on location is fine as well, if you find an Internet connection there you trust, however doing it ahead of time removes more possibility of smoke and mirrors.

(Note: Granted, even your current Internet connection could be compromised, but this system gives you att least assurances that you would have on your current connection, as opposed to this one stranger's software.)

## Instructions

All I want you to do is to create a text file with the following 6 pieces of information, each of which is 40 characters long, and label them. You don't have to know what it means now; hopefully there are enough knowledgable people at the cryptoparty that you can trust that it assures you of your software:

### [From here,](././.) you should find these clearly labeled on the page:

* GnuPG Windows installation sha1 checksum

* GnuPG Mac installation sha1 checksum

* GnuPG Linux installation sha1 checksum

### [From here:](././.)

* GnuPG Signing Key Fingerprint

  * Find where it says "..." The fingerprint is directly after that.

### [From here:](././.)

* Mozilla Signing Key Fingerprint

  * Find where it says "..." The fingerprint is directly after that.

### [From here,](././.) you should find this clearly labeled on the page:

* Enigmail Signing Key Fingerprint

It's pretty cool how this works. You'll basically be using the same cryptography software you use to
